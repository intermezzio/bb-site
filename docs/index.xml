      <description>An Arduino controls all of the electrical components on BB-8. The Arduino is connected to various other components, including motors and a bluetooth module, to drive BB-8.
Circuit Design Here is the layout of our circuit
Bluetooth BB-8 uses a HC-05 Bluetooth chip to communicate between the Arduino and a laptop.
On our laptop we convert the information from the joystick into speeds that our three motors should be going. We then send those speeds to the Arduino over bluetooth using the HC-05 blueetooth module to recieve the signal.</description>

      <description>Sprint Goal Our goal for this sprint was to get a two-wheel robot to drive in a sphere with pre-loaded code.
Subteam Progress Software In this sprint, we were able to preload a set of drive commands to the robot to enable it to drive in the hamster ball. The robot is controlled via Arduino Uno. Future steps include wireless control of the robot using Bluetooth and some controller such as a joystick or laptop arrow keys.</description>

      <description>Sprint Goal In this sprint, we wanted to make our robot wireless. This included incorporating our Bluetooth module and adding batteries.
Subteam Progress Software Our goal for this sprint was to incorporate the HC-05 bluetooth module onto the robot chassis in order to communicate wirelessley with the Arduino and sent commands in real-time. Our approach was to write a Python script that converted keyboard presses into commands that were sent over Serial to the Bluetooth module.</description>

      <description>The software, written in Python, creates a clean interface for sending commands to BB-8, converting a joystick input to BB-8 commands.
Joystick The joystick is written in HTML/JS using a canvas element. Since this code is very generic and not central to BB-8&amp;rsquo;s functionality, the frontend of this was based off of an existing HTML joystick. This code was modified to send the position of the joystick (indicating magnitude and direction) to a Python server.</description>

      <description>Sprint Goal Our goal for this sprint was to integrate the wireless drive code with the newly built, three-wheel chassis.
Subteam Progress Software Our goal for the final sprint was to update the firmware to drive with three wheels instead of two, and to make the controller more intuitive by creating a virtual joystick controller that would send commands to the robot. The joystick sends angle and magnitude information, which is converted to wheel speeds in a Python script in order to reduce the amount of computation that the Arduino does.</description>

      <title>Firmware</title>

      <description>The Arduino&amp;rsquo;s firmware is all written in Arduino C and allows BB-8 to receive commands from a laptop and output speeds to its motors. The firmware is short and to the point, as firmware should be.
Code Summary The code starts by setting all of the speeds to zero. When a bluetooth signal is received, it parses the command, which gives it three numbers: the signed percentage power values for the three motors.</description>

      <description>This project could be replicated with a $250 budget, as our team was resourceful in its use of materials to create an effective robot at a low cost.
Budget     Material Used Estimated Cost Amount Taken out of Budget     Borrowed Adafruit Motorshield $19.95 $0.00    Arduino Uno $23.00 $0.00    Roll of Duct Tape $8.58 $0.00    4V Rechargeable Batteries (3x) $7.</description>
